(10 points) Does order matter when writing firewall rules? What are situations whereorder doesn't matter? What are situations when order does matter?
Firewall processing varies from one binary/software to another, so it depends on the type of binary you're using. For example, iptables follows the logic of ordering, where if the packets matches a rule, it won't go to the next one. On the other hand, windows firewall follows anther logic where it goes through 4 phases other than "actual line ordering":
1- Authenticated bypass: which override block rules, 
2- block connection: which search for block connection matches, 
3- allow connection: which search for allowed connection matches 
4- Default profile behavior. The default behavior is to block unsolicited inbound network traffic, but to allow all outbound network traffic.
